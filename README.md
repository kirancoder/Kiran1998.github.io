## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **graduate in Aerospace Engineering** passionate about **trajectory design**, **optimal control**, and **spacecraft dynamics**.  
My work bridges **physics-based modeling** and **machine learning**, with a focus on solving nonlinear, uncertainty-aware control problems for autonomous and space vehicles.  

Recently, I’ve applied **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve **Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations** and developed **learning-based trajectory optimization frameworks** that combine analytical rigor with data-driven adaptability.
