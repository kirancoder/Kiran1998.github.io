# 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the major engineering and research projects I have worked on:

---

## **1. Trajectory Optimization of Landing Problem using PINNs**
- Implemented **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for optimal descent trajectory.  
- Compared with classical **Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle** solutions.  
- Achieved reduced cost-function error with custom activation functions (Rowdy, Full Rowdy).  
- Tools: PyTorch, JAX, Python, NumPy.

## **2. 6-DOF Aircraft Modeling and Stability Analysis**
- Built a **nonlinear 6-DOF aircraft model** with aerodynamic and propulsion subsystems in **Simulink**.  
- Linearized around trim to identify **phugoid**, **short-period**, and **Dutch roll** modes.  

##  **3.  Compact Fixed-Wing UAV Design**
- Designed a **portable UAV** meeting a **9 × 30 × 31 cm constraint**, with a **PVC payload tube**.  
- Used a **hybrid structure** of balsa, 3D-printed parts, and carbon fiber for strength and modularity.
